            One last tap on my trackpad: the codebase went public. Prezi's first open-source project released after months of hacking. I gazed out the ballroom's windows over Budapest rooftops. The dome of Parliament glowed red in the sun. My first project marked complete, I sat there filled with gratitude for this company I had fallen into.

            Two months before my tech-lead trusted this intern with preparing snakebasket[link to the blogpost?] for release, I was an American undergrad studying in Budapest. I stood then a fresh developer with half a computer science degree behind me. Green as they come, and hungry to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sought out the tech firm that everyone in Budapest was talking about. Sensing my enthusiasm for their challenges, Prezi extended an offer to join their engineers, which I accepted.
